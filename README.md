Project Title
AutoGuard: Vision-Based Obstacle Detection and Adaptive Navigation for Autonomous Robots

#Overview
A real-time system leveraging YOLOv10 to detect obstacles (humans, vehicles, humps, etc.) in a robotâ€™s path and generate navigation commands. The solution uses a dynamic safety zone to trigger context-aware responses, enabling safe autonomous movement in unstructured environments.

#Problem Statement
Current autonomous robots often:

1. Fail to distinguish between obstacle types (e.g., humans vs static objects)
2. Lack real-time responsiveness in cluttered environments
3. Use rigid path-planning systems that ignore contextual threats
4. Struggle with false positives from complex backgrounds
